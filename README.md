# mini-git

A minimal Git-like version control system written in C.

This project is built from scratch to explore how Git works under the hood, including object storage, hashing, and basic repository structure.

## Features

### Done
- `mygit init` — Initialize a new repository

### In plans
- `mygit hash-object <file>` — Hash a file and store it as a Git blob
- `mygit cat-file <hash>` — Inspect stored objects
- *(More features coming soon)*
